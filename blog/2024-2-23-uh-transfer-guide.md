# Transfer Student Guide  
_Created on August 4, 2023  
Last Edited on August 17, 2023_

## Introduction
This guide was written for transfer students attending [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). Written by a transfer student, I'll attempt to answer most of the common questions I see being asked in regards towards UH, or the Computer Science program, degree, and department.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
**1. What is the primary language at UH?** _I'm sorry this one is the longest one._
> UH uses C++ as it's primary language. If you know C++, you don't need to read this, lol. I'm a big advocate about understanding the fundamentals of one language, and if you come from Java, Python, Swift, etc. and you have learned Beginning fundamentals & Data Structures with a language other than C++, then transitioning into C++ will not be hard. The biggest change you may experience is the usage of pointers and references. You can find MANY videos about pointers & references on YouTube. Once you learn them, just start creating a simple project that will use those pointers, references, syntax usages, keywords, and functions that you will be using in C++. IF YOU DONT KNOW THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ONE LANGUAGE! You are then going to need to focus purely on C++. What I mean by this is to start watching videos and doing side projects about begineer fundamentals & Data Structures within C++.

**2. What professors should I take for 'x' class**  
> [CougarCS Discord](https://discord.gg/wEagwaXS7F) has a dedicated channel for class reviews for various professors (Majority of them being CS & math classes). You can also use [CougarGrades.io](https://cougargrades.io/) & [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/).

**3. I want to meet new people & possibly make new friends**
> JOIN CLUBS/ORGS! This is probably one of the most important things I will tell you for making/meeting friends. You can go on the [GetInvolved website](https://uh.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations) and find all the student organizations currently at UH. _Hint: You should join CougarCS_ ðŸ˜‰

**4.** I'm shy about meeting new people. How can I meet new people when they all know one another already? 
> CougarCS has develop a system of ambassadors! One man and woman have been selected to be the designated person for all new people who prefer to slowly integrate themselves. You can find out the ambassadors are by looking on the [CougarCS Discord](https://discord.gg/wEagwaXS7F) under the Officer's channel.

**5.** How does my GPA work as a transfer student
> UH doesnt take your previous GPA from any other institution into consideration. When you transfer to UH, you have no GPA. You start from the beginning, so with this in mind. Do NOT get D's or C's (if possible) in your classes. Always strive to do your best in your classes, when you notice yourself saying "I'll do this tomorrow" your slacking has already started. Create a schedule and stand by it. 

**7.** I want an internship, how do I get one?
> Start creating a resume. If you have projects under your belt its even better because it shows that you have a creative aspect and engineering aspect into creating the programs/softwares. If you don't have projects, start creating some. You will need to show recruiters that you can make something and display those skills. Lastly, start learning leetcode, since you'll be tested on your understanding with data structures and algorithms. Once you've done all that, start applying everywhere! Typically appliactions for the summer of the NEXT year will release the previous fall. (Ex: Summer 2024 internships, applications will release on August/September 2023). Apply to large companies and start up companies because you may never know what you will get! Good Luck!

**8.** Everyone is so smart and have projects. I feel like I'm nothing.
> First of all, you're not nothing. We all were in a place where we thought everyone so much better. So with that, CREATE!. Start making projects, learning leetcode, or whatever that makes you happy and help advance you academically. If you want to get an internship and don't have projects under your belt, so creating projects like websites, social media apps, research, or something that shows companies you are a innovative student. <ins>If you need help, ask for help, don't be scared to ask for help!</ins>
