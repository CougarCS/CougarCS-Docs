Behind the facade of cutting-edge technologies, promising career prospects, and the allure of Silicon Valley success stories lies a grim reality: the average computer science curriculum sucks. It is not just your university, even top-tier schools like [Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiFgB1lGxw) are known to have an awful curriculum.

Here are the resources I used to supplement these shortcomings.

## Mindset and learning

Before we begin learning, we must talk about mindset. The concept of mindset emerges as a central thread that can either propel us to great heights or shackle us in the chains of self-doubt. The way we perceive our abilities, approach challenges, and react to failures is deeply rooted in our mindset

## What resources are here and why?

> "If I handed you an operating system textbook, you'd probably end up using it as a cure for insomnia"

I have learned a lot during my time at my University. The differences between metamorphic and igneous rocks (14 credits I had to take), facts about the Pullman strike, and the types of lights used in dramas.
The classes actually related to my major are not that much better. I have yet to talk about semaphores or used assembly in live production. Therefore, let us skip the fluff.

These resources are meant to get you a job in Software engineering.

### Web Development

With the power to shape online experiences, convey information, and create interactive platforms, web development stands as a canvas for innovation and a gateway to endless possibilities.

The web is the biggest platform, and you might have seen these three resources before.

- Odin Project
- FreeCodeCamp
- Full Stack Open

Which one is the best? ~~The one you stick to.~~ Consistency beats all.
So you should be consistent with the Odin Project. One of the best resources as it dives you into the deep end. Don't worry about the difficulty curve, that's the point.

### LeetCode

Use Neetcode or Blind75. - [NeetCode.io Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
Learn Daily.

### Why Python?

### Other resources

## Conclusion

Best wishes in your journey. Don't get burned out. Its a tough journey. But the awards far outweigh it.
