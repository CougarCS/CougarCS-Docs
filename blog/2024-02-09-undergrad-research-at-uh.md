Lately, there's been quite a bit of requests from individuals seeking research opportunities for undergraduates. Finding such labs can be a bit challenging, so I've gone ahead and compiled a list of the ones that I know below. If there are any additional ones you'd like to include, feel free to let me know, and I'll be sure to add them!

Before you look at the table below, here's a [pdf](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/undergraduate/research/course-credit/research-projects-for-undergraduate-students-with-uh-cs-faculty.pdf) I found for Research projects for Undergrad Students with UHCS Faculty for Spring 2024!
